# Vue.js Starter App

## Overview

Oftentimes, I want to quickly throw together a simple SPA app to demonstrate some technology or meet some immediate need. These apps won't receive lots of traffic and don't require many fancy features. They may or may not be long-lived. In simple apps like that, the 'boilerplate' work of routing, auth, packaging, etc. can take as long to set up as the interesting bit of the app I intended to make!

To help with that, I intend this repo to be a simple SPA 'starter' app that I can copy as a starting point for future projects that will have all of that standard stuff setup the way I like it so that I can dive right in with building the interesting part of whatever app I'm working on.

## Technologies

* **Vue.js** for the frontend framework
* **Vue-router** for routing
* Two backend options:
  * **Dockerized ASP.NET Core (with K8s manifest)**
  * **Azure Functions**
* **Bootstrap 4** styling
* **AAD B2C auth**
* **Webpack** for packaging and minification
